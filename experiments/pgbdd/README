***
To run the pgbdd-mchess experiments, ensure that you have done the following:
***

- Build cake_lpr (run make in ../..)

- Obtain the benchmarks and tools (run ./setup.sh)

- (OPTIONAL) Install Coq, ACL2 and Isabelle checkers (see ../INSTALL_EXTERNAL for instructions as these might be platform specific)

To run the benchmarks:

1) Generate the LRAT proofs:

  ./gen_lrat_benchmark.sh  mchess

This will produce .lrat proofs in mchess/ and Urquhart/ and timing logs in timing_logs/

For example:

mchess/mchess-20.cnf
pgbdd: Node 5763.  Size = 39, Solutions = 6765. After quantification for column 0
...
2.647

2) Run the LRAT experiments

(OPTIONAL) Note: to run ACL2 / Coq checking, set the correct paths to your installation in run_lrat_benchmark.sh

  ./run_lrat_benchmark.sh mchess

For successful runs you should see output like this:

Running mchess/mchess-20.cnf
Checking mchess/mchess-20.lrat with CakeML
s VERIFIED UNSAT
Checking mchess/mchess-20.lrat with ACL2
... (a lot of output) ...
s VERIFIED
Checking mchess/mchess-20.lrat with Coq
Checking refutation ...
True
...

This will produce timing logs in timing_logs/
